📁 What Happens When You Use "npm install <package-name>":

1. Creates a folder: node_modules/ – stores installed packages.
2. Creates/uses package.json – stores project info + list of packages.
3. May create package-lock.json – locks the version for reliability.

✅ What is package.json?
It's a special file that stores information about your Node.js project — like:
1. Project name, version, author
2. Installed packages (dependencies)
3. Scripts to run your app (like start, test)
4. Project settings

✅ Local Installation 
The package is installed only in your project folder (inside node_modules/).
