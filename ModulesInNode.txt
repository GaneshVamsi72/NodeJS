âœ… What is a Module?
A module is a file that contains reusable code (functions, objects, classes, etc.) that you can import into other files.

In Node.js, there are 3 types of modules you can import:
ðŸ”¹ 1. Built-in Modules
(Node.js provides these)
fs -> File system (read/write files)
path -> Work with file paths
http -> Create servers
os -> System information

ðŸ”¹ 2. User-Defined Modules
(Your own files)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Third-Party Modules
(Installed via npm like axios, chalk, etc.)

In the ES Modules you may also see: import {<thing1>, <thing2>, ...} from 'package-path/module-path'; -> Advantage: Selective !!! No need of requiring all things !!!!!
But that works only if "type": "module" is added in package.json. Also we need to export things in the package/module using 'export' keyword in case of User-Defined Modules/Packages.

We only use entirely, either require() or import !!!!!

Loading is synchronous for 'require' but can be asynchronous for 'import'.
