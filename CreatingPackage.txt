✅ What is package.json?
It's a special file that stores information about your Node.js project — like:
1. Project name, version, author
2. Installed packages (dependencies)
3. Scripts to run your app (like start, test)
4. Project settings

Created automatically by: npm init -y
The -y flag in npm init -y stands for "yes".

It automatically accepts all default options for creating a package.json file, so you don’t have to answer each question manually like:
package name, version, description, entry point, test command, git repository, keywords, author, license

Without -y: npm init
